### Numerical derivation

![Numerical derivation](../img/math_diff.png)

Numerical 1st derivation of the second-degree polynomial <code>0.8*x^2+1.8*x+8.9</code> at the point <code>5.6</code>. With the first node, a symbolic first derivation is calculated, which is then evaluated by the second node at point 5.6.

### Numerical integration
