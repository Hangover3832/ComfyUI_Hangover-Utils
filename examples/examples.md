### Numerical derivation

![Numerical derivation](../img/math_diff.png)

Numerical 1st derivation of the second-degree polynomial `0.8*x^2+1.8*x+8.9` at the point `5.6`. With the first node, a symbolic first derivation is calculated, which is then evaluated by the second node at point `5.6`.

### Numerical integration
